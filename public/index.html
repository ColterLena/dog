      <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
      <p>
        The origins of breed can be traced back to 1800s Scotland, where
        affluent Scots wanted a more skilled hunting dog. Golden Retrievers fit
        the bill with their above average intelligence, ability to navigate
        difficult terrain, and superb swimming skills. The Golden Retriever's
        friendly disposition makes a kind and cuddly addition to the family.

      <h3>Cairn Terrier</h3>
      <p>
        Cairn Terriers trace their heritage back to the Isle of Skye off the
        coast of Scotland. The breed originally was grouped with the West
        Highland Terrier and Skye Terrier breeds, but the three breeds were
        reclassified as separate in the early 20th century. These feisty little
        dogs will make a wonderful family pet, but they may need some obedience
        training as puppies.

      <h3>Labradoodle</h3>
      <p>
        The Labradoodle is cross breed combining a Standard Poodle with a
        Labrador Retriever. The breed first gained notoriety in Australia during
        the 1980s when a breeder demonstrated their ability to be effective
        guide dogs. Labradoodle's friendly personality, hypoallergenic coat, and
        high-activity level make them a great pet for an active family.
