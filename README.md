In your first assignment, you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple,
published on the web.

You will create a simple website that will showcase one of your passions. This
is not about making the website flashy, but more about focusing on creating a
website and learning your new tools.

## Objectives

- Get to know your text editor
- Introduce yourself to working on the command line
- Write some HTML
- Publish a web page

## Requirements
- [ ] use `app-app HelloWorld` to create your first website.
- [ ] Compose a short essay (just a couple paragraphs at most) about a hobby you either enjoy or would like to learn about. We might expand on this page in future assignments, so pick something fun!
- [ ] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML elements. Give your webpage a simple header and footer as well.
- [ ] Deploy your site.
