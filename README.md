# Welcome to HTML
In your first assignment, you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple,
published on the web.

You will create a simple website that will showcase one of your passions. This
is not about making the website flashy, but more about focusing on creating a
website and learning your new tools.

## Objectives

- Get to know your text editor
- Introduce yourself to working on the command line
- Write some HTML
- Publish a web page

## Requirements
- [ ] use `app-app HelloWorld` to create your first website.
- [ ] Compose a short essay (just a couple paragraphs at most) about a hobby you either enjoy or would like to learn about. We might expand on this page in future assignments, so pick something fun!
- [ ] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML elements. Give your webpage a simple header and footer as well.
- [ ] Deploy your site.

# Welcome to CSS
Now that you have created some HTML, its time to give your page some personality.

For this assignment you will be taking the HTML you made for the last project and extending it to have some styling.

## Requirements

- Apply the ideas and stylings that you learn about in class.

- [ ] Take the CSS ideas and tools that were discussed in class and apply those to your homework.
- [ ] Apply colors, margin, padding, background colors, and font styles to the various elements of the page. Add `class=` where needed but try to keep to element selectors if you can!
